## To Consider
The following are some indications in order to understand the organization of the repository and how it is structured:

- In order to get the diploma the student needs to achieve 240 [ECTS](https://ec.europa.eu/education/resources-and-tools/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system-ects_en)
- Each course equates 6 ECTS and regarding to the European Comission *"60 ECTS are the equivalent of a full year of study or work"*
- The number before each course indicates the order I took them, whereas the position on the list represents the year.
