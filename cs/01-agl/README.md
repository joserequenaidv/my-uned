## Assignments
The practical part of the course (30% of the final grade) consists of two assignments. Each one represents the 15% of the final grade.

The exercises of the assignments are made in [JFLAP](http://www.jflap.org/), a software for experimenting with formal languages topics including nondeterministic finite automata, nondeterministic pushdown automata, multi-tape Turing machines, several types of grammars, parsing, and L-systems.
